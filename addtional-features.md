# RIP Demo - Price Protection System Presentation Slides

## Slide 1: Title Slide
**Visual**: Modern, clean title card with RIP logo/branding
**Title**: RIP Demo
**Subtitle**: Price Protection Using ZK and Ethereum Blobs
**Tagline**: A proof of concept built entirely on Ethereum's cutting-edge technologies

**AI Agent Instructions**: Create a professional title slide with tech-forward aesthetics. Include subtle visual elements suggesting privacy (lock icon) and blockchain (chain links or hexagons).

**Speaker Notes** (5 seconds): "Welcome to RIP, a proof of concept that combines Ethereum Blobs and Zero Knowledge Proofs for private price protection."

## Slide 2: What is RIP?
**Visual**: Split screen showing traditional insurance (complex, invasive) vs RIP (simple, private)
**Title**: What is RIP?
**Key Points**:
- Revolutionary Insurance Protocol
- Buy price protection for any product
- Complete purchase privacy
- Automatic claim payouts
- No personal data exposed

**AI Agent Instructions**: Create visual contrast between traditional insurance (paperwork, personal details visible) and RIP (clean interface, data hidden behind ZK shield).

**Speaker Notes** (15 seconds): "RIP lets you insure any online purchase against price drops. Unlike traditional insurance, we never see what you bought or how much you paid."

## Slide 3: Core Ethereum Technologies
**Visual**: Two technology pillars supporting the RIP platform
**Title**: Built on Ethereum's Latest Innovations
**Technologies**:
1. **Ethereum Blobs (EIP-4844)**
   - 90% cheaper data storage
   - Scalable price tracking
2. **Zero Knowledge Proofs (Groth16)**
   - Complete privacy
   - Mathematical verification

**Why These Technologies?**
- Cost-efficient at scale
- Privacy by design
- Trustless verification

**AI Agent Instructions**: Visualize as two strong pillars holding up the RIP platform. Use icons: database/storage for Blobs, shield/lock for ZK.

**Speaker Notes** (20 seconds): "We leverage two breakthrough Ethereum technologies: Blobs for efficient data storage and ZK proofs for privacy."

## Slide 4: Ethereum Blobs Explained
**Visual**: Comparison chart showing cost and efficiency
**Title**: Ethereum Blobs - Efficient Data Layer
**Key Points**:
- Stores complete product price data
- 90% cost reduction vs on-chain storage
- Perfect for oracle price feeds
- Maintains decentralization

**Visual Elements**:
- Cost comparison bar chart (Traditional: $100 â†’ Blobs: $10)
- Data flow diagram showing oracle â†’ blob â†’ smart contract

**AI Agent Instructions**: Create clean infographic showing dramatic cost savings and data flow from oracle to blob storage.

**Speaker Notes** (15 seconds): "Blobs let us store thousands of product prices affordably while keeping everything decentralized."

---

## Slide 5: Zero Knowledge Proofs Explained
**Visual**: Shield protecting user data while allowing verification
**Title**: Zero Knowledge Proofs - Privacy Shield
**Key Points**:
- Prove facts without revealing data
- "I bought something" âœ“
- "Price dropped" âœ“
- "I deserve payout" âœ“
- Product details: Hidden ðŸ”’

**AI Agent Instructions**: Visualize as a privacy shield with checkmarks for what's proven and locks for what stays hidden.

**Speaker Notes** (15 seconds): "ZK proofs let users prove they deserve payouts without revealing any purchase details."

---

## Slide 6: Merkle Trees - Price Verification
**Visual**: Tree structure with products as leaves, root on blockchain
**Title**: Merkle Trees - Trustless Price Oracle
**Key Points**:
- Oracle monitors all product prices
- Merkle root stored on-chain
- Complete tree in blob storage
- Cryptographic price proofs

**AI Agent Instructions**: Show simplified merkle tree with products at bottom, combining up to single root stored on blockchain.

**Speaker Notes** (15 seconds): "Our oracle builds merkle trees of current prices, storing just the root on-chain for efficient verification."

---

## Slide 7: Technology Integration - Purchase Phase
**Visual**: User journey from Amazon to blockchain
**Title**: Seamless Purchase Integration
**Flow**:
1. Shop on Amazon
2. Click "Insure with Crypto" (Chrome extension)
3. Generate ZK commitment (product hidden)
4. Pay fixed tier premium
5. Receive policy NFT

**AI Agent Instructions**: Create flow diagram showing Amazon â†’ Extension â†’ ZK generation â†’ Blockchain, with data becoming encrypted/hidden after step 2.

**Speaker Notes** (20 seconds): "Users shop normally, click our extension button, and the system creates a private commitment that hides all purchase details."

---

## Slide 8: Technology Integration - Monitoring Phase
**Visual**: Oracle continuously updating merkle tree
**Title**: Automated Price Monitoring
**Process**:
- Oracle tracks prices 24/7
- Updates merkle tree on changes
- Stores tree in blob
- Updates root on-chain
- Users notified of drops

**AI Agent Instructions**: Show circular flow of oracle checking prices â†’ updating tree â†’ storing in blob â†’ updating chain.

**Speaker Notes** (15 seconds): "Our oracle continuously monitors prices, updating the merkle tree whenever prices change."

---

## Slide 9: Technology Integration - Claim Phase
**Visual**: ZK proof generation and automatic payout
**Title**: Private, Automated Claims
**Steps**:
1. Detect price drop
2. Get merkle proof from oracle
3. Generate ZK proof of eligibility
4. Submit to smart contract
5. Instant payout

**No Reveal**: Product, prices, personal data

**AI Agent Instructions**: Visualize as locked box going into verifier, green checkmark coming out, money flowing to user.

**Speaker Notes** (20 seconds): "When prices drop, users generate a ZK proof that validates their claim without revealing what they bought."

---

## Slide 10: Complete System Architecture
**Visual**: Technical architecture diagram
**Title**: End-to-End Flow

**Components**:
- **Frontend**: Chrome Extension + Vercel App
- **Oracle**: Price Monitor + Merkle Tree Builder
- **Storage**: Ethereum Blobs (price data)
- **Blockchain**: Smart Contracts + ZK Verifier
- **Privacy**: ZK Circuits + Commitment Schemes

**User Flow**:
1. **Purchase**: Amazon â†’ Extension â†’ Commitment â†’ Policy
2. **Monitor**: Oracle â†’ Merkle Tree â†’ Blob Storage
3. **Claim**: Price Drop â†’ ZK Proof â†’ Payout

**AI Agent Instructions**: Create clean architecture diagram showing all components and data flow. Use different colors for different phases (purchase=green, monitor=blue, claim=orange).

**Speaker Notes** (25 seconds): "Here's our complete architecture. Users interact through a Chrome extension, our oracle monitors prices in blobs, and smart contracts handle policies using ZK verification."
