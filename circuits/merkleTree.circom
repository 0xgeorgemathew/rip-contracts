/*
 * MerkleTreeInclusionProof: Proves that a leaf exists in a Merkle tree without revealing its position
 *
 * PURPOSE: This circuit enables privacy-preserving price verification. The oracle maintains a Merkle
 * tree of all product prices, and users can prove their product's current price is in the tree
 * without revealing WHICH product they're claiming for.
 *
 * WHY MERKLE TREES: They provide O(log n) proof size and verification time, making them efficient
 * for proving membership in large sets while maintaining privacy about the specific element.
 *
 * @param levels: The depth of the tree (e.g., 4 levels = up to 16 leaves)

         * CONDITIONAL ASSIGNMENT LOGIC (implementing if-then-else in circuits)
         *
         * Convention: pathIndices[i] determines sibling position:
         *   - pathIndices[i] == 1: sibling goes LEFT, currentHash goes RIGHT
         *   - pathIndices[i] == 0: sibling goes RIGHT, currentHash goes LEFT
         *
         * WHY THIS WAY: MerkleTreeJS uses this convention where the pathIndex
         * indicates the position of the sibling, not the current node.
         *
         * CIRCUIT TRICK: We can't use if-statements in circuits, so we use arithmetic:
         *   - Multiply by pathIndices[i] to select when it's 1
         *   - Multiply by (1 - pathIndices[i]) to select when it's 0
         *   - Add the results to get the final value
         *
         * EXAMPLE with pathIndices[i] = 1, siblings[i] = 0x123, currentHash[i] = 0x456:
         *   leftChoice1 = 1 * 0x123 = 0x123
         *   leftChoice2 = 0 * 0x456 = 0
         *   left = 0x123 + 0 = 0x123 (sibling goes left)
         *
         *   rightChoice1 = 1 * 0x456 = 0x456
         *   rightChoice2 = 0 * 0x123 = 0
         *   right = 0x456 + 0 = 0x456 (currentHash goes right)

 * DRY RUN EXAMPLE: Proving IPHONE15 (price $899) is in the tree
 *
 * Tree structure (4 leaves, 2 levels):
 *                  ROOT

 *          Hash_A        Hash_B

 *    IPHONE15  PS5    LAPTOP  CAMERA
 *     ($899)  ($499)  ($1299) ($799)
 *
 * Inputs for proving IPHONE15:
 *   - leaf = Poseidon("IPHONE15", 899000000) = 0xAAA...
 *   - pathIndices = [0, 0] (IPHONE15 is leftmost: left at level 0, left at level 1)
 *   - siblings = [PS5_hash, Hash_B] (siblings at each level going up)
 *   - root = ROOT_hash (public input that everyone can verify)
 *
 * Execution trace:
 *   Level 0:
 *     - currentHash[0] = 0xAAA... (IPHONE15 hash)
 *     - pathIndices[0] = 0 (sibling goes right)
 *     - left[0] = currentHash[0] = 0xAAA... (we go left)
 *     - right[0] = siblings[0] = PS5_hash (sibling goes right)
 *     - currentHash[1] = Poseidon(0xAAA..., PS5_hash) = Hash_A
 *
 *   Level 1:
 *     - currentHash[1] = Hash_A
 *     - pathIndices[1] = 0 (sibling goes right)
 *     - left[1] = currentHash[1] = Hash_A (we go left)
 *     - right[1] = siblings[1] = Hash_B (sibling goes right)
 *     - currentHash[2] = Poseidon(Hash_A, Hash_B) = ROOT_hash
 *
 *   Final check: ROOT_hash === root âœ“ (Proof is valid!)
 *
 * PRIVACY ACHIEVED: Verifier only sees the root hash, not which product or price!
